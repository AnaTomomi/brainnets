In this directory you can find an example set-up how to reproduce the network coarse-graining pipeline
documented in Ref XXXX.

If everything is set-up correcly, simply running

	python pipeline.py

should  

1. compute louvain communities
2. compute consensus communities
3. match the communities (used for visualization)
4. plot communities on brain
5. plot alluvial
6. plot coarse_grained matrices
