=== Module level structure of the brainnets package ===

==== List of modules: =====
* in order of "depth"

#Params level:
*brainnets_sample_params.py (used by all 2nd level stuff, if this module is availble)
: a sample setup file for the user describing the details of the study
: the package should however be (more or less) usable without these 
: convenience functions 

#Top level:
*scripts.py
: some (nice, simple in implementation) scripts which will run common analysis combinations 
: (e.g. load data, generate network, compute globalProperties, 
: compute globalProp statistics, plot statistics (in some way) )
: (This file also for convenience instead of having multiple short script files.)

#Second level:
*parpropcomps.py (used by scripts.py)
: functions for computing some or all of the properties
: (in parallel, for )

*statscomps.py (used by scripts.py)
: functions for computing statistics for different 
: (performing statistical testing) for some of the functions

*plots.py (used by scripts.py)
: plotting tools

#Third level:
*gencomps.py (used by parpropcomps.py)
: contains functions for computing results based on
: (non brain specific) data
: all new things that are computed should be added here
: i.e. contains macro, meso, and microscopic properties

*netgen.py (used by parpropcomps.py)
: generate network out of a adj. matrix

*dataio.py (used by all 2nd level modules)
: file input and output
: determines also filenames if not given

*statistics.py (used by plots.py and statscomps.py)
: general statistical computations, includes internal parallellisation
: this should be kept independent from any settings so that it can be easily used in other projects as well!

#4th level:
*settings.py (used by many..)
: universal settings (fixed at all times) 
: some default settings (that can be overridden by explicit commands)
