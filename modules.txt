=== Module level structure of the brainnets package ===

==== List of modules: =====
* in order of "depth"

#1st level: (with which user is mostly in touch with
* compprops.py 
: functions for computing properties and other metrics in parallel

* compstats.py 
: functions for computing statistics for different 
: (performing statistical testing) for some of the functions

* plots.py 
: plotting tools

* exports.py 
: used for exporting network data for visalization

* slurm_submit.py
: a simple file used for running an (arbitrary) python file 
: on triton with specific params
: see the actual file for details

#2nd level:
*gencomps.py
: contains functions for computing results based on
: (non brain specific) data
: all new things that are computed should be added here
: i.e. contains macro, meso, and microscopic properties

*netgen.py 
: generate network out of a adj. matrix

*dataio.py (used by all 2nd level modules)
: file input and output
: determines also filenames if not given

*statistics.py (used by plots.py and compstats.py)
: general statistical computations, includes internal parallellisation
: this should be kept independent from any settings so that it can be easily used in other projects as well!

*settings.py
: universal settings (fixed at all times) 
: some default settings (that can be overridden by explicit commands)
